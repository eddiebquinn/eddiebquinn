    <p>
    I'm not that good at writing about-me's, it has never been one of my strong suits. I'm a 24-year-old backend developer from London, with a passion and interest in data and automation. I got my start in tech through coding discord bots geared towards helping server users overcome addiction. As time has gone on I've developed other interests, but I still do actively develop a multiple server addiction bot called <a href=https://github.com/eddiebquinn/Ricky>Ricky</a>.

    I genuinely have a passion for writing good code, and often am very anal developing unbloated, well-documented code Despite this I am still learning and fully expect to find new ways to achieve these. I have a care for privacy and security (that some would say verges on paranoia), and hope to one day start a youtube channel documenting ways people can protect their digital sovereignty. I plan shortly to set up my home lab and get into self-hosting my infrastructure to help me achieve this.
