## About

I build reproducible systems.

My work sits at the intersection of infrastructure, automation, and security hygiene — focusing on predictable deployments, version-controlled configuration, and reducing operational fragility.

Currently working in enterprise technical support while transitioning into infrastructure and platform roles.

Most operational infrastructure lives in private GitLab repositories.  
This GitHub contains selected public projects — implementations I’m willing to stand behind.

## Selected Projects

- **Infrastructure Lab** – Multi-node Proxmox environment with automated provisioning and HA K3s cluster.
- **Automation Tooling** – Operational scripting (PowerShell/Python) focused on reducing MTTR and manual overhead.
- **Declarative Systems** – Nix-based configuration management with Git as a single source of truth.
- **Algorithmic Work** – Brainfuck interpreter and Huffman encoder implemented from first principles.

## Principles

- Rebuilds should be boring.
- Rollbacks should be safe.
- Configuration should read like documentation.
- Nothing important lives outside version control.
